    <p class="speech">
        My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am
        extremely glad! <p class="direction">[Squeezes his hand]</p>Now this is a surprise, my
        darling... How are you?
    </p>

    <h4 class="lomov">LOMOV.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Thank you. And how may you be getting on?
    </p>

    <h4 class="chubukov">CHUBUKOV.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and
        so on. Sit down, please do.... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all
        about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal
        in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going
        anywhere, my treasure?
    </p>

    <h4 class="lomov">LOMOV.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
    </p>

    <h4 class="chubukov">CHUBUKOV.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're
        paying a New Year's Eve visit!
    </p>

    <h4 class="lomov">LOMOV</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Well, you see, it's like this. <p class="direction">[Takes his arm]</p> I've come to you,
        honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or
        twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and
        you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting
        excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
